  <para>
    This document describes a set of coding style guides for developing
    programs in the C# language.
  </para>
  <para>
    A style guide is a set of mandatory requirements for layout and
    formatting. Uniform style makes it easier for other developers to grasp
    the essence of your programs quickly.
  </para>
  <para>
    A style guide makes you more productive because it <emphasis>reduces
    gratuitous choice</emphasis>. If you do not have to make choices about
    trivial matters, you can spend your energy on the solution of real
    problems.
  </para>
  <para>
    In these guidelines, several constructors are plainly outlawed. That does
    not mean that developers using them are evil or incompetent. It does mean
    that the constructs are not essential and can be expressed just as well
    or even better with other language constructors.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you already have programming experience, you may be initially
    uncomfortable at giving up some fond habits. However, it is a sign of
    professionalism to set aside personal preferences in minor matters and to
    compromise for the benefit of the group.
